* Optimal Search with A* ...

# Guaranteed to find an optimal solution when /heuristic function/ $h(s)$ is admissible

[[png:astar]]

#+begin_resume
currently, the most prevarent method for optimal graph search is A* algorithm.
In A*, a node has g-value, which is the current shortest cost from the initial state,
and h-value, which is a result of a heuristic function h, which should be admissible in the optimal search.
Their sum, f, is a lower bound of the cost of the shortest path, f*.

In order to prove optimality,
A* is required to expand all nodes whose f is smaller than f*.  Due to this
requirement, A* expands the nodes with the smallest f value each time.

However, this description lacks one important aspect of A*.

#+begin_alignright
*Rule-of-Thumb is [ /h/ ] but it's like a folklore!*
#+end_alignright

#+begin_resume
There are several conventional wisdoms on the tiebreaking of A*.

In the earliest work, 
the original paper on A* by Hart, Nilsson and Raphael
proposed a strategy of selecting the nodes with the least h value.
We call this tiebreaking as h-based tiebreaking, and use the notation surrounded by brackets.

Another important method is LIFO tiebreaking, which expands a node in most-recently-generated-first.
It seems to be common already in 1985.

In recent years, we rarely find a detailed description on tiebreaking.
It is sometimes said: it's known to perform well or it's common.
There are sometimes no mention at all.

Overall, it seems that the current rule-of-thumb is to use h-based tiebreaking.
#+end_resume

* [ /h/ ] is underspecified                                          :AAAI16:

*What happens if there are still /multiple/ nodes with the same /h/ ?*

→ There must be a *2nd Tiebreaking /X/* : denoted as [ /h/ , */X/* ]

Example -- A* with *[ /h/ , /LIFO/ ]* : Selects the nodes with /f_{min}/. 

+ *IF* multiple nodes have /f_{min}/, selects the nodes with /h_{min}/  (1st tiebreaking).
+ *IF* multiple nodes have /h_{min}/, select the most recent node (2nd tiebreaking).

|-----------------------------------------------+---------------------------------|

#+begin_resume
However, h-based tiebreaking has a severe problem that it is still underspecified.
What happens if there are still multiple nodes with the same h?
There should be some further tiebreaking criteria which selects exactly one node among them.
In most papers, this kind of detail is not mentioned at all.

We found that the implementation by burns et. al. uses h-based tiebreaking followed by LIFO tiebreaking,
and the current fast downward uses h-based tiebreaking followed by FIFO tiebreaking.
Both of these are not specified in the paper.
In other words, these details are not considered important.

#+begin_resume
However, tiebreaking is actually quite important.
We plotted the number of nodes whose f value is equal to f*,
versus those with f value less than equal to f*,

In this figure, we can see that the most nodes have the f value equal to f*.
We call these nodes as the final plateau.

The final plateau is where the optimal solutions exist.
And where all nodes have the same f-value.

Thus, in this plateau,
the search is controlled solely by the tiebreaking.

#+end_alignright

#+begin_resume
To further investigate the importance of tiebreaking behavior, we tested
two commonly used tiebreaking strategies, namely h-LIFO and h-FIFO.
h-fifo is the default setting of Fast Downward.

Each criterion is applied in a dictionary order.
For example, [h,fifo] means that,
if there are multiple nodes have the same f value, it selects the smallest h.
If there are still multiple nodes have the same h value, it breaks ties according to FIFO.

We tested these strategies on IPC instances.

#+begin_resume
These domains are characteristic by its large number of zero-cost actions.

Addressing the problem caused by zero-cost actions is important because it
frequently appears in practial application domains.

First of all, both of these domains originates from industrial applications.
Openstacks originates from Operations Resarch.
Regarding Cybersec, I hope the listeners remember the great talk by jorg hoffman in the last ICAPS.

Another interesting example is a realistic transportation domain with fuel optimization.
In such as setting, the domain will assign 0 to all action costs except drive-truck.

#+begin_resume
Well, I didn't explained exaclty why these zero-cost made the difference.

These domains are unfriendly to h-based tiebreaking. This is a plot of the final plateau, with differnt definition.
This time, not only f is equal to f*, but also h should be equal to 0.

In openstacs and cybersec, almost all nodes are on the x-y line.
In other words, at almsot all search nodes, h=0.
In these domains, h-tiebreaking has almost no effect.

Thus, to improve upon LIFO, we should understand Final Plateau.

However, in zero-cost domains, almost all h values are 0, and h-based tiebreaking is useless.
The problem is, how can we give a useful guidance in such a region?

* Depth-based Tiebreaking                                            :AAAI16:

[[png:final-plateau4]]

#+begin_resume
Here, we propose a depth-based tiebreaking.

Depth characterises a number of steps from the entrance of the plateau.

If the parent of a node have the different f and h value, then the child is
a plateau entrance, and its depth is 0.

If the parent of a node have the same f and h value, then the child has a depth larger by one.
#+end_resume

* Non-trivial Question: How to use the /Depth?/             :noexport:AAAI16:

Assume h=0 (because 0≦h≦h^*=0)

Within Final Plateau f=f^*, *all solutions are cost optimal* regardless of depth

#+begin_alignright
because *all edge costs are 0.*
#+end_alignright

[[png:final-plateau4-2]]

#+begin_alignright
#+begin_larger
We found that *DEPTH BIAS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.*
#+end_larger
#+end_alignright

#+begin_resume
The next problem is how to use the depth.  In designing such a strategy, we
should note that within final plateau, any solutions are cost optimal
because all edge costs are 0.
In this context, introducing a bias in each depth is not a good idea.
#+end_resume

* FIFO: selecting the smallest depth?                                :AAAI16:

# /FirstDepth/ tiebreaking strategy : ［ h, /fd/ ］

[[png:final-plateau5]]

#+begin_resume
For example, what happens if we always prefer the smallest depth?
We call such a stratefy First Depth.
FirstDepth behaves like a breadth-first search and FIFO tiebreaking, which did not perform well.

FirstDepth tends to search the neighborhood of plateau entrance exhaustively,
and takes too much time to reach the appropriate depth.

[[png:final-plateau6]]

#+begin_resume
The opposite scheme, LastDepth, also have a problem.  Last depth, which
always selects the largest depth, is in certain condition equivalent to
depth-first LIFO tiebreaking.
It may quickly pass and miss the important depth.

Finally, we propose RandomDepth tiebreaking which removes the depth bias.
Actual implementation of RandomDepth is as follows.

When h-tiebreaking fails, RandomDepth selects a random depth.

Then a Random Order selects one node at random.

RandomDepth Tiebreaking can search the final plateau uniformly and sparsely.
This is an interesting aspect similar to Rapidly exploring Random Tree.

Finally, the experimental evaluation.  Along with the original IPC

The one which has a positive cost represents a realistic key resource,
such as wood, fuel or electricity.

We created 620 zerocost instances consisting of 28 domains.

+ Demonstrated the use of inadmissible heuristics for optimal search
+ Many potential extensions
  + Use *plateau-limited macro actions* (cf. Marvin, but different purpose)
  + *Plateau-limited monte-carlo random walk* (cf. Arvand)
  + Direct analogue for model-based planners (SAT/IP/CSP-based planners)

 Now lets review the participants.  [h, FIFO] is a conventional
 tiebreaking strategy which first break ties according to h, When there are
 multiple nodes with the same h, it then breaks ties accoding to the FIFO
 order, in other words expanding the oldest node.

 [h, LIFO] is another conventional tiebreaking strategy which also uses
 h-tiebreaking, but when there are multiple nodes with the same h,
 it expands in LIFO order, or expanding the most recently generated node first.

 Finally, [h, RD, RO] is our proposed method. It also uses the h-based
 tiebreaking.  However, when multiple nodes have the same h, it puts them
 into several buckets according to the depth d, then select a bucket at
 random. From the selected bucket, it selects a node at random.

 We tested these tiebreakings with a standard competition setting of 30 min,

 heuristics, which are both the state-of-the-arts but
 whose values are computed in a completely different manner.
